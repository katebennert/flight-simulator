# :beers: Brew Punk: Flight Simulator :beers:

The Beer Punk: Flight Simulator is a single page web application that helps you find beer that we think you'll enjoy using Brewdog's extensive database of craft beers in their public [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/). 

## Installation

There is no additional software required to run this app!

(Note: update this if json server is added.)

## Usage

The application will generate a "flight" of beer suggestions based on the user's preferences as a seasoned craft beer drinker. The user can then view each beer's profile which includes information about the beer's origin, food pairings, and a recipe for the bold few who'd like to try their hand at home brewing!
